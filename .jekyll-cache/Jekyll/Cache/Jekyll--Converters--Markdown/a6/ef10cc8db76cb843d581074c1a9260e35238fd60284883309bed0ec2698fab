I"e<p>Working with IT Help Central and <a href="http://www.depts.ttu.edu/ithelpcentral/cts/">Classroom Technology Services</a>, for a year now I have had some great opportunities.</p>

<p>I recently visited with Extron at one of their training facilities and received certifications for Extern’s <a href="http://www.extron.com/training/controlspecialist.aspx?s=th07">Control Specialist</a> and <a href="http://www.extron.com/training/set.aspx?s=th07">The School of Emerging Technologies</a>.</p>

<h2 id="control-specialist">Control Specialist</h2>

<p>Within this course we learned about Extron’s control equipment and software and configured a test unit. While in the class it provided the student with ideas we can take back to our organization and implement. This two day class went in-depth and moved quickly to get all the great ideas of how to use the configuration software. This will be beneficial when needing to address issues in our classrooms we support.</p>

<h2 id="school-of-emerging-technologies">School of Emerging Technologies</h2>

<p>The School of Emerging Technologies for Higher Education provides in-depth instruction on new and evolving AV technologies. Educators who complete this two-day school attain a greater understanding of digital AV system design skills and knowledge of different technologies.</p>

<p>There were many different technologies we talked about, between 4K resolution, wireless AV technologies, streaming technologies and more. This class was beneficial in taking new technologies back to the classroom and how we can improve teacher-student interaction and new learning environments.</p>
