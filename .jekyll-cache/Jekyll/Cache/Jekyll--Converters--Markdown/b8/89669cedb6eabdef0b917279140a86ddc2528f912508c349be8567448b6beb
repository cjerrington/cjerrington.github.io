I"<p>What to expect with the New Year upon us? More posts!</p>

<!--more-->

<p>Since <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquisition_of_Twitter_by_Elon_Musk">Twitter has been bought by Elon Musk</a>, many folks were concerned what the social giant would turn in to. Some left, other’s stayed, and others moved to a decentralized social platform, <a href="https://joinmastodon.org/">Mastodon</a>. I have been on <a href="https://mstdn.social/about">mstdn.social</a> for a little while now and find the activity I post about to get more tracktion and involvement from like folks, than I did on Twitter. You can find me as <a href="https://mstdn.social/@cjerrington">@cjerrington</a>.</p>

<p>Anyways, from the folks that I have met, there are some that are posting with a purposed called <a href="https://100daystooffload.com/">100 days to offload</a>. The whole point of <code class="highlighter-rouge">#100DaysToOffload</code> is to challenge yourself to publish 100 posts on your personal blog in a year. There’s nothing fancy about it, no real rules, just a challenge to post more about anything big or small.</p>
