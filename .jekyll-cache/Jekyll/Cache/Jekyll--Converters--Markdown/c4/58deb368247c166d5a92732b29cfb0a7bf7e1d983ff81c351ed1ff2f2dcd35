I"<p>I recently reinstalled my laptop with <a href="https://ubuntubudgie.org/">Ubuntu Budgie</a>, and had to reinstall all my apps. One of them was <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> to keep up with my blog posts to render this site.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>I found the installation instructions for <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/ubuntu/">Ubuntu based</a> operating systems. While it was easy to follow the prerequisites and the copy and paste or simple tying of the commands, I was in a hurry and wanted a full script to do the install.</p>

<p>Jekyll has very simple requirements and most should already be installed for the majority of major Linux distros. The steps are simple, really just making sure a response is generated.</p>

<p>Requirements</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/">Ruby</a> version <strong>2.5.0</strong> or higher, including all development headers (check your Ruby version using <code class="highlighter-rouge">ruby -v</code>)</li>
  <li><a href="https://rubygems.org/pages/download">RubyGems</a> (check your Gems version using <code class="highlighter-rouge">gem -v</code>)</li>
  <li><a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/install/">GCC</a> and <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/">Make</a> (check versions using <code class="highlighter-rouge">gcc -v</code>,<code class="highlighter-rouge">g++ -v</code>, and <code class="highlighter-rouge">make -v</code>)</li>
</ul>

<p>With our prerequisites all in place we are then to install some packages and set our Ruby Gems to be installed to the user profile. This is configured with your <code class="highlighter-rouge">~/.bashrc</code> profile. Personally my bash profile has a <code class="highlighter-rouge">~/.bask_aliases</code> where I added the necessary export commands to set <code class="highlighter-rouge">$PATH</code> variables.</p>

<p>Once this was all done, I decided to make a bash script to automate this for others in the future. It does use Jekyllâ€™s default instructions. With this script it does check if you are running the script as <code class="highlighter-rouge">sudo</code> since we are installing a few packages as well, then does the prerequisites check, and if it all passes, will install the needed items.</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/e77ddac11667c01a62ae8361f1962dba.js"> </script>

<p>So to help make this a little easier for you we can do the following</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>curl <span class="nt">-s</span> <span class="nt">-L</span> https://gist.githubusercontent.com/cjerrington/e77ddac11667c01a62ae8361f1962dba/raw/d1c02e73e03e96e0446511c21faf4aa228faad31/install-jekyll.sh | bash
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This will automatically download the script and run it for you.</p>

<p>So now that you have Jekyll installed, lets start a new site!</p>

<p>Create a new Jekyll site at ./myblog</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>jekyll new myblog
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Change into your new directory.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>cd myblog
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Build the site and make it available on a local server.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>bundle exec jekyll serve
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Browse to <a href="http://localhost:4000">http://localhost:4000</a></p>

<p>Happy Blogging!</p>
