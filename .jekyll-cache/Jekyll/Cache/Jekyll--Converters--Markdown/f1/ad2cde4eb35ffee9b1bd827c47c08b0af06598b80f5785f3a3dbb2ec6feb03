I"<p>Did you know that <a href="https://netlify.com">Netlify</a> allows for you to have a configuration file to tell it how to deploy your project?</p>

<!--more-->

<p>There is a special <a href="https://docs.netlify.com/configure-builds/file-based-configuration/#sample-netlify-toml-file"><code class="highlighter-rouge">netlify.toml</code></a> file that can be used for many settings you can configure when deploying your site. I want to focus on the redirects in this post specifically.</p>

<p>When building a site Netlify gives you a <code class="highlighter-rouge">random-word-phrase.netlify.app</code> domain. This is useful for a single app where you dont need a <a href="https://docs.netlify.com/domains-https/custom-domains/">custom domain</a> attached.</p>

<p>I recently moved to Netlify for hosting instead of <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> to publish my Jekyll site. the setup and move was easy to do too. I did get my <code class="highlighter-rouge">random-word-phrase.netlify.app</code> subdomain initally, but you can change that. So I changed mine to <code class="highlighter-rouge">cjerrington.netlify.app</code> to match some of the other naming schemes of other items.</p>

<p>I found this post on <a href="https://www.netlify.com/blog/2017/05/11/migrating-your-jekyll-site-to-netlify/">Moving your Jekyll site to Netfify</a>, and Netlify makes this easy as well straight from your dashboard when making a new project with them.</p>

<p>Once the site was built, I could go to <a href="cjerrington.netlify.app">cjerrington.netlify.app</a> and (once DNS was update) <a href="claytonerrington.com">claytonerrington.com</a>, but just like <a href="www.claytonerrington.com">www.claytonerrington.com</a> forwards to the APEX domain, I wanted the <code class="highlighter-rouge">*.netlify.app</code> to auto redirect which it does not from the website configurations.</p>

<p>Thus comes in the redirects:</p>

<div class="language-toml highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nn">[[redirects]]</span>
  <span class="py">from</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="s">"https://cjerrington.netlify.app/"</span>
  <span class="py">to</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="s">"https://claytonerrington.com"</span>
  <span class="py">status</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="mi">301</span>
  <span class="py">force</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="kc">true</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Pretty simple right? Now there is another option. To add a <code class="highlighter-rouge">_redirects</code> file, and with Jekyll we need to include this in our <code class="highlighter-rouge">_config.yml</code> file for building.</p>

<p>This syntax is pretty simple as well.</p>

<div class="language-text highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code># Redirects from what the browser requests to what we serve
/home              /
/blog/my-post.php  /blog/my-post
/news              /blog
/cuties            https://www.petsofnetlify.com
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>When you hit <code class="highlighter-rouge">/home</code> we want to redirect that to the root of the domain <code class="highlighter-rouge">/</code>. This redirect could be realated to how a <code class="highlighter-rouge">.htaccess</code> file works as well for redirects.</p>

<p>As mentioned earlier, there are plenty of <a href="https://docs.netlify.com/configure-builds/file-based-configuration/#sample-netlify-toml-file">config</a> options you can use with the <code class="highlighter-rouge">netlify.toml</code> file.</p>
