Using the open source [Umami](https://umami.is/) hosted on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) as well using their Postgress database option. Followed the [Running on Vercel](https://umami.is/docs/running-on-vercel) docs and also [wrote](https://claytonerrington.com/blog/the-good-side-of-analytics-umami-vercel) a little more on how to get this setup, kinda like the missing items too.

You can check out the public page of Analytics for my site as well.
