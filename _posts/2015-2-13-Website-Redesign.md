At [Word Publications](http://wordpub.com/) they wanted to have a website that empasised the advertisers on the printed map. 

I took the current design they had and implimented Google Maps and [jQuery MapIt](http://lifeinthegrid.com/labs/mapit/) to place the locations on the interactive map.

MapIt can run off XML or JSON to control all the places in the map. I decided to try something new and use JSON. It was easier to use and understand when creating a new project.
