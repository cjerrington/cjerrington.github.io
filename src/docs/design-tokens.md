title: Design tokens

Edit all your preferences (colors, fluid text sizes etc.) in `src/_data/designTokens/*.json`.

Additional colors, variants and gradients for custom properties are automatically created in `src/assets/css/global/variables.css` based on the colors set in `colors.json`. If you change names you should edit `variables.css` as well and check if the names are used elsewhere in the template.
Admittedly, I went a little bit crazy there with the new CSS color syntax stuff.

In the [style guide](/styleguide/) you can see how everything turns out.
