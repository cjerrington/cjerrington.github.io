title: Favicons

The favicons used are based on the recommendations from the [How to Favicon article on evilmartians.com.](https://evilmartians.com/chronicles/how-to-favicon-in-2021-six-files-that-fit-most-needs)

All favicons are in `src/assets/images/favicons`, and copied over to the root of the output folder.

There is no automatization in place to create them.

I recommend keeping the file names as they are, since they are referenced like that in different places.
