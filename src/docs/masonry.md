title: Masonry
---

There is the idea of making masonry layout a native part of CSS grid, using `grid-template-rows: masonry;`. It is [not yet to be seen on the horizon](https://caniuse.com/mdn-css_properties_grid-template-rows_masonry), but it is already included in the starter (inside the `grid.css` composition).
Until then, a small script will help us to get the effect.

It gets loaded by opt-in.
Set `masonry: true` in your front matter to activate.
