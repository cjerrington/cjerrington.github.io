title: Platforms (icons)
---

Find available social media / platform icons in `src/_includes/svg` (prefixed with `platform-`).
If you add new icons, prefix their name with "platform-".

In `personal.yaml` you can add new platforms and their URLs. The key should be the same as the name of the icon. For example: `mastodon: 'https://front-end.social/@lene'` and `platform-mastodon.svg`.

https://simpleicons.org/ features a great variety of free SVG icons for popular brands.
