My interest in web design and photography began in high school. In addition to his design and photography skills, he has technical expertise in installing and implementing computer systems and designs.

I have worked on a wide variety of websites including children's books, utility districts, businesses, portfolios, and more. Being able to create a user-friendly website for the client and audience is what I strives for.

Currently, I am an AWS Technical Engineer and enjoy sharing what I have learned through my blog. I find writing things down to be a valuable tool. It allows me to reflect on my experiences and learn from them.

Additionally, my blog serves as a resource for me to revisit past strategies and tips for increased productivity and problem-solving. I hope that what I write about helps those who visit my website as well.
