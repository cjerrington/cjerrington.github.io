Oh, if only I could love you today
Then things would be all that I expected.
This love is pulling my strings like ballet
I don't want my feelings to go unsaid.
Yes, you are perfect for any guy to love,
You are the prettiest thing I've ever seen.
Oh, you are something lovely from above,
Believe me loving you is like nicotine.
It is like I have been caught in a net.
When I am not with you, I cannot sleep.
I have been in love since we first met.
Tonight I'll try not to go home and weep.
Oh, if only I could love you today,
Then just maybe will all things be okay.
