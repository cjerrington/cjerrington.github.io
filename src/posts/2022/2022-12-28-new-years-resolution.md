What to expect with the New Year upon us? More posts! 

Since [Twitter has been bought by Elon Musk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquisition_of_Twitter_by_Elon_Musk), many folks were concerned what the social giant would turn in to. Some left, other's stayed, and others moved to a decentralized social platform, [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org/). I have been on [mstdn.social](https://mstdn.social/about) for a little while now and find the activity I post about to get more tracktion and involvement from like folks, than I did on Twitter. You can find me as [@cjerrington](https://mstdn.social/@cjerrington).

Anyways, from the folks that I have met, there are some that are posting with a purposed called [100 days to offload](https://100daystooffload.com/). The whole point of `#100DaysToOffload` is to challenge yourself to publish 100 posts on your personal blog in a year. There's nothing fancy about it, no real rules, just a challenge to post more about anything big or small. 

You can follow along on my site, [#100daystooffload](/100DaysToOffload/), or others:
- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/hashtag/100DaysToOffload)
- [Mastodon](https://fosstodon.org/tags/100DaysToOffload)
- [Write.As](https://fosstodon.org/tags/100DaysToOffload)
- [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/100daystooffload)

Lets get to posting this year!
