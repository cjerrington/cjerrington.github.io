I recently reinstalled [Fedora 38](https://www.fedoraproject.org/) on my laptop and needed [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en) installed. I was going through and needed to install and update quite a few applications, and Node was stuck at version 16. I finally found a few additional articles on how to install a specific version of Node.
