I have quite a few games on my phone that I play I've had for quite awhile, but one thing that is not fun are ads that have been popping up while playing the games. This is not that relaxing to sit back and get lost in the story line of the game. It is amazing the graphics that are put into the games now for a mobile game. Sometimes though it's nostalgic to go back to a few of those 8-bit graphic games and enjoy the simplicity of those.

## Retro Bowl

This is a 16-bit style football game where you are the manager of a football team and get to play, build your team, and is fun to play.

## Retro Highway

A motorcycle racing game to hit the road fast and dodge the other cars, doing jumps, and turbo boosts!. Level up your bike and skills to race along highways, desserts, and the moon.
