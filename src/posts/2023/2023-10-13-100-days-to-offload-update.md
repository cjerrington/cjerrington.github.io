Welcome to the 59th post! When I started this challenge earlier this year, it was a way to motivate me to share my thoughts and some coding experience along the way.

I began writing about the things I’ve done to help myself and others. A few years ago, I started a website called [Useful Scripting Network](https://usefulscripting.network/), to share good examples and explain the code and what it does. After a while I was wanting to share the thoughts there along with my blog. I do have some [analytics](/blog/the-good-side-of-analytics-umami-and-vercel/) on my website just to know what content is being read and what people like reading. I do have some pretty [popular posts](https://analytics.claytonerrington.com/share/9FNL88ifrvc1v0EY/claytonerrington.com) that always get hundreds of views a month, and it’s kinda cool.

- [File dialog with PowerShell](/blog/file-dialog-with-powershell)
- [PowerShell GUI with WPF](/blog/powershell-gui-with-wpf)

When I write, most of the topics are the challenges I faced and like to share my solutions in hope that it helps someone else. I also look at this challenge as a way to archive my own journey through issues with [PowerShell](/tags/powershell/), my new journey with [AWS](/tags/aws/), neat things with [Python](/tags/python/), and [more](/tags/). I have even gone back to my own blog post to fix a solution later, and I just knew I had written about it.

Not too long ago was looking at my post [archives](/archive/) and I had a few less posts some months than others. 100 posts in a year is only about 8 a month. I thought that was doable and took on the challenge. Many posts are about my coding process and progress this year, and it has been a crazy ride. I’ve even seen some improvements on my programming style and ability to write a solution for now, but also thinking about the future of the script and the process it’s being implemented for.

Since being able to share this on social media and join in with others while you’re posting throughout the year has been a lot of fun. I’ve interacted with new people and got back into writing, coding, started following some [other blogs](/blogroll/), and learned new things as well.

Now here’s to finishing the [challenge](/100DaysToOffload/)!
