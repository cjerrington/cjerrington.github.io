Most of my writing is done on my computer. In my last [post](/blog/default-apps/), I was at an event reading my RSS feed and saw a post I thought I could write while I was out. While it worked, not everything worked as planned.

I was able to use my note app of choice and begin writing the content and updating it. I was able to add my front matter to the completed note, open GitHub Mobile, and commit the new post and let it build. Then I saw the problem.

Initially, I had the items line-by-line, but Markdown needs an extra space for a new line in the build. I re-comitted a change to mark the post as a draft, then waited till I got back to my computer to quickly make the changes needed.

Overall, the process wasn't that bad, just something I hadn't done before and wanted to see how my setup would handle such a problem, or even a quick update while mobile. For new posts, I think I'll stick to my computer to make new posts and ensure the formatting, content, and spelling is correct as well.
