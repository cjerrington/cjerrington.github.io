Wow! It is nearly the middle of November and 11 months into the year. I started the [#100DaysToOffload](/100DaysToOffload/) challenge at the beginning of the year, and this post will make number 75!

I started this challenge not knowing anyone or anything, as I had joined the [Fediverse](https://joinmastodon.org/) as an alternative to mainstream social media. After following a few people that had similar interests, I found this challenge and decided I could bring life back into my website and blog again. The website was a project based website and little blog posts here or there throughout the years, but could do better.

Another goal I had for this year was to expand my knowledge of programming, python, PowerShell, AWS, technology, and more. The other project I had that was neglected was the [Useful Scripting Network](https://usefulscripting.network/) and I have brought some of the idea of the site to my blog and share things as my self on my own website, rather than another one I manage. I was able to see with my [analytics](/blog/the-good-side-of-analytics-umami-vercel/) that I had some good posts that were being found by others. Part of that could be sharing them to Mastodon and other social media as well. 

Along with writing for the 100 Days to Offload, you read others who are writing as well. This could be similar topics or new ideas as well. Some of the people I have come to know are part of this journey, and it is kinda neat being back in the blogging world sharing ideas, challenges, experiences, and learning. It is kinda neat getting involved and how others in the Fediverse take application of others blog posts and share those back out with others. I've been included on the [PowerShell Weekly](https://psweekly.dowst.dev/profile/clayton-errington/) and [11ty Bundle](https://11tybundle.dev/authors/clayton-errington/) which as a nice surprise when I was reading them, then one day noticed my post on the site! My goal to help share my experiences and process, while figuring out problems, is being noticed and shared with others. 

Overall, it's been a great year! Learning [Docker](/tags/docker), [AWS](/tags/aws), [11ty](/tags/11ty), and more. My initial idea with the challenge was to post 100 items of the success and explain the coding process I went through to get a working solution. I can admit that has been a bit of a challenge, but have slowly gotten into just writing as well. With 25 posts to go, we'll see how the year ends as well. 

Thanks for everything this year, it's been a blast!
