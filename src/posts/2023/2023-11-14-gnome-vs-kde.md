Podcasts are something I've started listening to more lately, and picked up "The Linux Cast" and listened to the battle between the [Gnome](https://www.gnome.org/) and [KDE](https://kde.org/) desktop environments. It was entertaining listening to them defend their desktop environment across several different requirements like usability, default apps, customization, and why someone should use the desktop environment.

I've used both of these over the years and still come back to Gnome myself. There is something simple that I like and it keeps working. I've also used the [Budgie](https://buddiesofbudgie.org/) desktop as well, and while there are many of them, they each have their own benefits of advantages and disadvantages. My recent use case in my Linux environment is using something that works and doesn't need much setup, configuration, and useful.

Gnome for me, lately, has actually made some improvements that brought me back from using the [Cinnamon](https://projects.linuxmint.com/cinnamon/) desktop. With the recent update to Gnome it still has that classic feel I remember starting with and many new improvements for today's modern technology and functionality.

You can listen to the Podcast as well and see which side you fall into.
