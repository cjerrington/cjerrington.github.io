## Selfhost

**Docker**

* [NextCloud](https://nextcloud.com/)

* [FreshRSS](https://freshrss.org/)

**Virtual Machine**

* [PiHole](https://pi-hole.net/)

**Manual install**

* [Jellyfin](https://jellyfin.org/)

That is a lot of computers, operating systems, and software. Most of the equipment has been hand-me-down from jobs I've worked, or passed along from friends. Since I use all of these systems, I have found a way to keep them in sync with what is needed between them, but also find my self lost at times. This is where NextCloud has helped, keeping my files in one spot.

At the start of this year, I wanted to get into [Docker](/blog/dockerize-minetest/), and MineTest was my first app. When I was handed the OptiPlex 790, I knew just what to do with it. Moving my Docker apps to this machine has helped get more exposed to Docker and try new things. With most apps now, instead of the bare metal install methods, I start looking for the Docker install.

There is of course FOSS software I've been using more of as well, but that list will go on forever. The most useful one would have to go to [Thunderbird](https://www.thunderbird.net/en-US/) and [Kdenlive](https://kdenlive.org/en/) for some of the video editing I've done.
