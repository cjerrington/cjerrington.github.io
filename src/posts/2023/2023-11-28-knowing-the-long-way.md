Automation is great, it solves a lot of problems in our daily lives and even does the repetitive and mundane tasks so we don't have to. So what's the problem? Well, what happens when the automation stops working, has an issue, or some other issue. Yes, computers and robots stop working and someone or something has to puck up where it was left off.

When we have new employees that join the team, it was part of my responsibilities to train them on the deployment systems and the software that is used. I would always start them on the long process of manually doing the entire process. Once they got that part squared away and understood, then we'd move on to the next part. This would be the building blocks to know the process, how the software works, what it's doing; really getting down to the nitty gritty of the whole operation.

A lot of what I was doing was getting the new team member to see how things worked from the ground up. You don't learn to drive a car by sitting in the drivers seat and pushing buttons. I guess you could, but you wouldn't know what you are doing. So you first learn about driving before actually driving down the parking lot. Once you learn the process, you eventually start to learn new things about the vehicle and know that when you press the gas pedal, that sends a signal to the gas tank to allow gas into the engine, it burns, turns gears, which turn the wheels, which cause movement, and so forth. You don't learn to be a mechanic first, you learn the car and how it works. Then apply that to your driving.

Similar thoughts go into the automation we build for our AWS systems. We need to know what the automation is doing either to the letter or at least the overall process. What I loved seeing in the folks who learned the "long" process, which was the normal process until I automated most of it, was the "Oh now you tell me there is an easier way to do this?"

Yes, I taught them the long process because things break, fail, don't work, and in order to know how to fix and either pick up when the process left off or restart the process, you need to know what is happening. When your car stops accelerating you begin to look at certain signs: do I have gas, is the brake engaged, is the car on? All of the questions are asked from knowing the process of how the car works.

Also knowing process allows you to troubleshoot even when things do go as planned and working. Sometimes a process runs and you didn't expect that one issue to appear, but you know where to start looking when that happens. To improve the process, you have to know the process. Sure this might have a programming mindset to it in the automation realm, but nearly everything we do has a process, workflow of inputs and outputs.
