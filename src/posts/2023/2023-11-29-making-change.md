This weekend we purchased a few items from the store like we normally do. For this purchase we had cash, which is a little rare for today's age, and we got our change back.

Once I got home I was putting the change in the jar, since every penny adds up quickly, when I noticed it. I had two special coins! One was a [Bicentennial quarter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Bicentennial_coinage) and a [Wheat Penny](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lincoln_cent). The chance of getting both of these older coins in one cash transaction I consider kinda rare.

I wouldn't expect the Bicentennial quarter to be that rare, as it was minted in the mid 1970s and distributed in 1975 for circulation. That is only 48 years ago. Surprisingly, coins stay in circulation about 30 years and go all over the country. So to find a Bicentennial quarter really isn't that surprising. When I was younger I had a part time job, and in my tips, I got many of these quarters in my time there. At least once a month, maybe twice. Some nights I even looked through the quarters to just find them.

The Wheat Penny I got this weekend was a 1955 coin, and still in pretty decent condition, if I say so myself. I own a few of these already mostly from what my grandfather has saved for me. He has been the one who has gotten me into collecting coins in a way.

I don't have a special coin saving process at this time, but probably should start to invest. I have a few other coin collections like the [50 State Quarters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/50_State_quarters) program, a few [Gold Dollar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacagawea_dollar) coins, [half dollars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half_dollar_(United_States_coin)), and a few random coins from other countries. The thought that one day these might be worth something is still there and why I keep saving some of these. Some have been worth a good value as well, to the right place, too.

There is something neat about the designs and types of mints that I like to keep, so that one day it will be something to pass along as a piece of history. Who knows, maybe the value will be something by then.
