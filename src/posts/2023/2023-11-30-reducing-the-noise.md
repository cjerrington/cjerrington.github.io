Over the last few months I’ve noticed more how many notifications, pop-ups, and other things that take my focus away from what I’m working on. One of the first steps I tried to reduce my email I was receiving.

After looking through my many email accounts, I noticed there are many subscriptions I don’t read or even go through. I’ve started to see what I could unsubscribe from and also if I even need that account anymore. I still have a long way to go, but starting is the hardest part.

On my phone, I’ve turned off notifications from many apps. I do have a few mobile games, and while many of the games send you a notification when a process is done, or it’s time to come back and play, I just don’t need them. I’ll play when I get there and don’t need the message. There have been days I ignore the Lock Screen of the notification as a reminder to go back and look at the app. However, many times I do not.

There are even desktop notifications as well! Many browsers and websites are able to send messages to the desktop of something the website is trying to tell you. Some of these are helpful - the work related ones. Email and Teams notifications are probably the biggest offender. I am in quite a few group chats and some of those, luckily, Teams allows you to mute and only notify when you’re tagged, or it’s important.

Sometimes you just need to focus on the task in front of you and these pesky notifications are trying to steal your attention. Here’s to a moment of silence as we can become distraction free. I’m wanting to regain my attention span and focus on what is important at the moment and get that task completed to the best of my ability.
