I’ve been using the Linux operating system for about 20 years now! Just saying that sounds crazy even for me. It has been something to learn and keep up with to a degree on a few things. Watching the systems change, evolve, upgrade, improve over the years has been an experience.

Many of those years, I read articles of “this is the year for Linux” or “the desktop you’ve been waiting for”. The rise of the free operating system and improvements to the Linux desktop experience has gotten a lot better. However, many other people I talk to think it’s for the computer nerds, you have to run everything from the command line, you don’t have the same applications as you do on other operating systems.

Maybe 20 years ago, this was the case, but in some ways I think even with the improvements to the ecosystem, we might be in the same boat.

I was trying to install some software, which was pretty basic. Recently I wrote about some issues installing software - [NodeJS on Pop!\_OS](/blog/2023-11-2-installing-nodejs-on-pop!_os/) and [NodeJS on Fedora](/blog/installing-nodejs-on-fedora/). This time was [Neovim](https://neovim.io/) and [NvChad](https://nvchad.com/). Like all Debian based distros, you get used to the `apt` package, and it just works.

There’s also other application options like flatpak, snap, deb, linking binaries, compiling from source, docker, anymore? As a new user to Linux, how do you choose a method, which is best, use a mix? When you read other forums that seem to answer these questions, you get flooded with yet another wide range of opinions.

Within this saga, I started with the apt install based on the website’s instructions. Then went to install NvChad which requires a specific version or higher. Well, the apt version was too low. Next, did more searching and found the latest version is available in flatpak, a desktop application file, snap and a tar ball.

I tried a few of these and once installing, the way you run the program was slightly different. The commands and typing (or copy and paste), were a lot. With flatpak you had a few choices even to choose from while installing and still not sure what the differences were. After getting the installation done, I had to fiddle with my profile so certain things worked right still.

After the many ways to get this to just work, I was getting a little frustrated for what should be a simple process. I could only imagine what a newer Linux user would be experiencing. Why doesn’t it just work? This should be easier. Why do I need to type so much? What is this command? Should I be running this?

I remember when the software store came to Ubuntu and how I thought that was revolutionary! It was going to make installing programs easier. It probably has, but also made it easier to see what the Linux alternative or equipment is on the Linux ecosystem.

The many other ways to install software and the user experience is what makes the operating system what it is. The benefits of one method over another are user choice as well. That alone is what makes it hard. Even for the developers, they have to provide their software in a multitude of installation platforms.

One day I hope this continues to be a smooth process and is the same no matter the process. There is also no limit to the amount of distributions either, and they all claim to be better than the next. The users of those systems have various claims about what they like as well. So yes, have we really change the environment in the last twenty years?
