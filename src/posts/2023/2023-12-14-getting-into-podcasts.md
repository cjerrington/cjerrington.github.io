This year I was talking to a friend and Podcasts came up, and he mentioned one that was related to our field of work. I started listening and was hooked. It was presented well, educational in a way, and interesting to hear the stories.

I started listening on my phone's default Podcast app, then fund a few others. I really liked Sticker, but just as I got started listening, they announced they were shutting down. Then I found [Pocket Casts](https://pocketcasts.com/) by the way of social media, and it was also just a great choice.

Just like many other End of the Year recaps, Pocket Casts had one as well, so let's see. I switched over halfway through the year, so this is only half the data.

## Top 5

* [Darknet Diaries](https://pca.st/darknetdiaries) - 13 hours, 22 minutes
* [ThunderCast](https://pca.st/b1vl7ydz) - 4 hours 9 minutes
* [The Linux Cast](https://pca.st/AOT9) - 3 hours 20 minutes
* [Linux Downtime](https://pca.st/hf41) - 2 hours 18 minutes
* [Archive 81](https://pca.st/archive81) - 1 hour 24 minutes

## Totals

* 19 hours 5 minutes
* Skipped 2 minutes15 seconds
* Variable speed 8 hours 1 minutes
* Trim Silence 8 minutes 38 seconds
* Total time save 8 hours 12 minutes

For not listening to Podcasts before and have a few more than 5, and 19 hours! I think that is a quite a great start. I did listen to more this year, this was just what was accounted for during half the year.
