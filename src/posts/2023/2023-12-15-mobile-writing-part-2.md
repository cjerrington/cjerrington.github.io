After a first attempt at [mobile blogging](/blog/posting-from-my-phone/), I found a process that works better for my work flow.

Throughout the day, I have ideas and need to write them down. This could be a coding process, a thought to remember, the start of a blog post, and more. I love a good notes app. I’ve gone through quite a few and use a few for different things. Lately it’s been [Simplenote](https://simplenote.com/).

Simplenote is just that. A basic text editor that is synced to a web client. You have Items in the mobile app that make sense. If you need a task list, there’s a quick way to get that started. You can tag your notes, and this looks like the easiest way to organize your notes.

What I’ve actually done for a few of the recent blog posts, is type up the whole post from the phone, or at least start it. Then, once I’m back at my desk, open the web client and copy the text into the [TinaCMS](/blog/implementing-tinacms-with-11ty/) post I’ve started for my website.

Now once I'm working on my computer, I have the benefit of a new plugin as well the [LanguageTool](https://languagetool.org/) plugin helps with my spell check, grammar, and more. This plugin does have the ability to rewrite text with AI, but I still feel that is not the way to write articles.

This gives me the time to reread what I wrote to make sure it reads well, and is something I’d like to publish. If I’d like to create code blocks, I can do so easier on my computer. If I’d like to add links to certain items, I can do so with the right links. Once done, the git commit, push, and done.

In a pinch, writing blog posts this way for me works better. Much better than writing an article in the note app and trying to use a mobile git process.
