Growing up I had a few collections, and this weekend I pulled one out.

One collection didn’t start out as one, but over time it did. It was one of those things I didn’t realize I was starting to collect them, but as time went one I found I decided to keep more and started looking for them. It was a coin collection.

I few weeks ago, I was excited to get a [few coins in my change](/blog/making-change/) and was kinda neat. This weekend I pulled part of my collection out and started looking at what I have. Collecting coins and, over currency, probably started when the US Treasury started the national quarter mints. It was something I started to follow and got excited when the next quarter was released and actually wanted change back.

As time went on, I got the books to track your progress and save the coins and after a while my grandparents helped me get the other mints and quarters I was missing. Even to the day I still enjoy looking at the change and remember it was like needing that one quarter.

I’ve passed on collecting many of the newer quarters after this initial period of mints. I still keep the few bicentennial quarters and old ones. Many of the older coins were minted with real copper or silver and those may have more value later on, the older they get.

Not only do I have the national quarters, but a few gold and silver dollars, Franklin half dollars, coins and currency from a few foreign countries. I'm not sure how I obtained a few of these, but it is amazing to look at the detail put into the coin mints and paper currency as well.

I've always wondered how other countries have adopted the use of their dollar coins. The US Gold and Silver Dollar coins are not in circulation on the masses, but appears that the $10 Peso is used regularly and accepted at the same value as a $10 paper bill. I do know that when the 1979 Silver Dollar was introduced, the US Mint was hopeful that people would adopt the coin, and was almost immediately rejected by the public.

I am not a fancy coin collector, but do take a decent care for the items in my collection. It's always fun to look at the change you get, and see the dates, and the coins to potentially add to the collection. Maybe one day I'll reach out to a coin seller to see if I have anything of value.
