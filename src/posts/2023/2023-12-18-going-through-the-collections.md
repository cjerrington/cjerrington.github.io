Growing up I had a few collections, and this weekend I pulled one out.

One collection didn’t start out as one, but over time it did. It was one of those things I didn’t realize I was starting to collect them, but as time went one I found I decided to keep more and started looking for them. It was a coin collection.

I few weeks ago, I was excited to get a few coins in my change and was kinda neat. This weekend I pulled part of my collection out and started looking at what I have. Collecting coins and, over currency, probably started when the US Treasury started the national quarter mints. It was something I started to follow and got excited when the next quarter was released and actually wanted change back.

As time went on, I got the books to track your progress and save the coins and after a while my grandparents helped me get the other mints and quarters I was missing. Even to the day I still enjoy looking at the change and remember it was like needing that one quarter.

I’ve passed on collecting many of the newer quarters after this initial period of mints. I still keep the few bicentennial quarters and old ones. Many of the older coins were minted with real copper or silver and those may have more value later on, the older they get.

Not only do I have the national quarters, but a few gold and silver dollars,
