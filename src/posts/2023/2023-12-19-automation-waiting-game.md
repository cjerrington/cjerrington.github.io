Over the years things have become quicker. The internet, cars, games, life, and more. I've often heard that technology is outdated within six months as advancements keep happening. What we tend to expect, as things become more automated, is the timeliness of its completion of the process to become quicker as well.

How many times have you walked into a grocery store with the sliding doors, and you are walking so fast, the doors don't open in time for you to reach them? What about making a purchase on Amazon and still have to wait four days instead of the two-day delivery? When you open that new computer for Christmas and still have to wait on the progress bar to install new software, stream that TV show, and just wait?

I'm sure we've all had some of these experiences where we are impatient for the completion of the process, and often take for granted the tireless computers that have to talk to each other to do what we want them to do. As automation has taken over our life in many ways, we are not used to waiting for something. I see this daily at home when advertisements come on in the middle of a show, we can no longer wait the minute and a half for the content to return, and buffer for us to keep watching.

The other day I was at a curbside delivery store, and enjoyed the people watching. I noticed people on their phones, people show up and then leave, not wanting to wait any longer. The automation of ordering the products is fast, but still relies on a link in the chain to do the action. Your automation is only as fast as your slowest point.

I guess it all comes down to what you are willing to be patient for. Also, if it is something you have control over, where and how can you make those improvements. I saw a team discussing why a process was so slow, then they looked at the code and there were extra verification and status checks that were not necessary.

Just today I had created a new subdomain for a small project and was waiting on Codeberg pages to assign the SSL cert and get all the required items they need to check to host my small static content. I updated my DNS to host the simple site and was waiting on Codeberg since the DNS was already resolving, but the hosting side was not ready yet. I began looking into other ways to build the site to accomodate other paths and overcome by obstacle of the website not showing in the browser correctly. 

Well I had a meeting and came back, and decided to give it a shot. Afterall it was an SSL error and it did need time to propagate correctly, but I was just not patient enough. The automation to add a DNS record in their system, check my DNS, ensure the repo was ready, all the above, I was not ready to wait on the automation.

A simple motto I started implementing was: work smarter, not harder. Sometimes we try to account for all the little things in our automation process, which we should, but we don't need to make it complicated either. What are you willing to wait for, and for how long, the next time the automation task runs?
