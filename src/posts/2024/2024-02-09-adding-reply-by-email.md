As I was wrapping up the year last year, I noticed several other blogs I followed had a "reply by email" instead of a comments section or something similar. I had included [Webmentions](https://indieweb.org/Webmention) to my website and when I post that link online, those social media sites continue to trigger the comment from that platform to be a comment on the website itself and post. This was neat to set up and worked pretty well.

I noticed a lot of the content was also being pulled from my [RSS](/feed.xml), and wanted a way for those readers to connect as well. This reply by email shows up on the website as well, and would also allow an organic user to the site be able to comment directly as well.

My first blog post I got a reply to was [My Linux Journey](/blog/my-linux-journey/), and that individual had also recently written a similar blog post, and we shared similar experiences. This lead to a new connection and appreciation for sharing our thoughts and how they might help others as we share our content. A few more replies came in where people were thanking me for the post as it helped them, or even needed more assistance.

It is a simple thing to add, and I was able to connect with people further on the items they found my website for as well. That is the point of a website and blog, I think as well. Being able to share my experiences and how I solved a problem, and hearing that it helped someone else, or just getting to connect to others in another way. Last year, the [100 Days to Offload](/100DaysToOffload/) project really helped me through my learning experience and share that to help others.

It's nice to hear that people found your website and took the time as well to interact with you beyond just consuming the content on the website.
