This is a test post from a new CMS called [Mattrbld](https://mattrbld.com/).

> **Mattrbld is a headless content management system** for teams and individuals who don’t want to be locked into a specific platform or framework. It offers a fast and flexible way to create, edit and manage content while giving developers complete control over the shape of the data, so they are free to use any frontend technologies they like.

This is a new headless CMS solution that syncs with your Git solution, and you can control all the schemas for the content types and Static Site Generator solutions out there.

Currently, this is still in development, but plans to be open sourced and allow users to self-host the project. I do like that idea and will try out writing some posts from here as well.

I’ll have to implement the draft system on my website better, so the updates can be synced, and I can push production posts when wanted.

I’m excited to see where this project goes.
