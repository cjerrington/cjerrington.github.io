While deciding what goals I wanted for my website and blog for this next year, I reviewed what I've already done.

In 2024 I wrote 23 posts, which is about 2 posts a month but with most of the posts in June.

This next year I'll be joining the [100DaysToOffload](https://100daystooffload.com) again, after completing it in [2023](/blog/year-in-review/).

There is also another challenge called [the100pics](https://the100.pics/) created by [Hyde](https://lazybea.rs/). I'm excited to bring out some archived photographs and some new ones take this year. I'll still be a blog post and give a little description of the photo as well.

I do plan on still writing some blog posts about some of the programming items and how I've solved various problems. It's really neat to write about a problem you solved and explain it so it might help someone else. Even now, I still refer to my own blog cause I know I wrote about something similar to what I'm trying to work on now.

Here's to 2025!
