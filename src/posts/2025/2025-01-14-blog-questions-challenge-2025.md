I've seen this blog post floating around and in some RSS feeds and thought I'd take the time to answer these questions as well. Especially since my website has been around for 10 years, this is a good time to share some past, present, and future things and why I still enjoy having a website.

## Why Did You Start Blogging In The First Place?

This question is part of the evolution of my website. I got into web design while I was in high school and it was part of my electives. I enjoyed creating something in the web browser and it really sparked my interest in programming in general. Once I graduated high school and went to college it was also the time frame where an online presence in a professional manner was on the rise. It was also a way for me to showcase my projects I had been working on and start my own business in a way.

Over the next few years I slowly began writing more of how-to type of posts or sharing my solution to a problem. Adding [analytics](/blog/the-good-side-of-analytics-umami-vercel/) to my site was really only a way for me to see if what I have been writing about has been helpful to others, and some of the most top visited pages are on my [stats](/stats) page and that is impressive to me. Knowing that the problem I solved, is helpful to someone else.

## What Platform Are You Using To Manage Your Blog, and Why Did You Choose It?

I am currently using [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) or `11ty` for short which is a static site generator. I enjoy the workflow I created with NodeJS and [setup scripts](/blog/plop-in-automation/) to get started writing. I have had my share of WordPress blogs, but the costs of "web hosting" and upgrades to WordPress always had their woes. I ditched WordPress and found [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) while using my GitHub account and this was the Static Site Generator of choice at the time and only supported solution on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

Jekyll started to become a pain to work with while hosting on GitHub and for a few other reasons found 11ty to be a good fit. I was working on a VueJS app for work and in the Node environment so 11ty fit right in. Also the community was great and helpful while learning how to use the new platform.

I kept using static site generators since I enjoyed programming and it gave me the ability to design and build my website as I saw fit. In January 2023 I did the final [11ty Redesign](/blog/11ty-redesign/). I enjoy static sites a lot and even created a project to help support them called [Static.Quest](https://static.quest)

## Have You Blogged On Other Platforms Before?

I have used WordPress for my personal websites and for a few clients. I've tried some other CMS solutions like Drupal, but WordPress won out. Recently with static sites I've tried things like [TinaCMS](/blog/implementing-tinacms-with-11ty/) and a web based solution [mattrbld](https://mattrbld.com/). Seeing how a CMS solution could work for a static site was a game changer.

## How do you write your posts?

To start new posts, I use [PlopJS](/blog/plop-in-automation/) and usually use VS Code to write the posts. All the posts are written as [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) files. This does make writing new content quick and easy. Theres some `yaml` heading data on each file, then the content. Once the post is finished it is committed to a git repository and then built and served on Vercel.

## When Do You Feel Most Inspired To Write?

Since most of my blog posts describe an issue I was facing and how I solved it, that is usually when I start writing. I find writing and sharing a solution to a problem I had helps me learn it and hope it helps someone else as well solve a problem they might have.

## Do You Publish Immediately After Writing, Or Do You Let It Simmer A Bit As A Draft?

Usually I write a draft and work on a post over time. Some topics require research and ensuring a process I am explaining works as intended. While I was completing the [100DaysToOffload](/100DaysToOffload) I would write then post immediately. Then I would see a spelling or grammar mistake and would fix that. So, I've learned to slow down and let the draft sit for a moment then publish when ready.

## Whatâ€™s Your Favorite Post On Your Blog?

Probably anything from the [100DaysToOffload](/100DaysToOffload) challenge. Going through this challenge I found I began to write better and really took on a lot of topics. I learned at lot as well during this process with a new job and plenty of things to discuss. Some posts were spawned from a conversation I had with a friend which led me to write about it to share with them but also to come back to later when I might need it again.

- [Knowing the long way](/blog/write-fast-deploy-update/)
- [Network Usage Since Last Boot](/blog/network-usage-since-last-boot/)

- [Powershell GUI with WPF](/blog/powershell-gui-with-wpf/)
- [Bookmarks in PowerShell](/blog/bookmarks-in-powershell/)
- [Bookmarks in Bash](/blog/bookmarks-in-bash//)

## Any future plans for your blog?

This year in 2025 I've already started the #100DaysToOffload again to get back into blogging. At the end of 2023, I had a plan to write still but not as intense as the challenge - [24 posts](/archive/) is a decent amount I'm happy with.

Also I started [the100pics](/tags/the100pics/) challenge to showcase some photography. I used to take a lot of photos on a Nikon D40 and will dig out the digital archives and share some of those along with some new photos.

## Who Will Participate Next?

I'll follow a few other examples and refrain from encouraging anyone in particular to participate, but would encourage you to write one yourself.
