I was searching for an answer to a problem and found a slogan that seemed to hit home.

```text
Never be afraid of sharing what youâ€™ve done and being proud of good, quality work
```

This was on another blog site that, like me, shared some information that once helped them and thought to share it with others. This simple phrase can relate to writing a blog post, calling a meeting with your team at work and doing a lunch and learn, or anything else. The best way to learn is by sharing. Too often I've seen knowledge be lost because it's been horded and kept only those who know... But how does that really help anyone?

Sharing knowledge is not only good for those around you to know something that you do, but through that discussion you can learn more yourself and maybe even improve what you've already done. It is still okay to be the subject matter expert and be the go-to person, but sharing is caring, and if you've done something you think is great, others will appreciate that as well.

What you've done might help the others around you too; maybe the topic directly, or how you approached your issue and resolution will help them with their project and tasks.

So, don't be afraid to share what you've done and how you accomplished it.
